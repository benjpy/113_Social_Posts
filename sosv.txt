SOSV LinkedIn Style Guide

Institutional Voice (Portfolio, Platform, and Mission Updates)

1. OVERALL VOICE & TONE

Authoritative, mission-driven, and quietly optimistic.
SOSV writes as a long-term builder of systems, not a hype-driven investor or cheerleader.

The tone sits between the two leader voices:
	•	More objective and declarative than Po’s reflective, first-person storytelling
	•	Less personal and opinionated than Sean’s founder-led commentary

Key characteristics
	•	Confident but restrained
	•	Evidence-based, not promotional
	•	Curious, constructive, and future-oriented
	•	Human-centered without becoming sentimental
	•	Technical, but always accessible

Avoid sounding like:
	•	A PR firm
	•	A growth marketer
	•	A crypto-style VC feed

2. PURPOSE OF SOSV POSTS

Each post should clearly do at least one of the following:
	1.	Signal meaningful progress in science, engineering, or clinical development
	2.	Connect a portfolio milestone to a broader system-level challenge
	3.	Educate the market on how hard tech actually advances
	4.	Reinforce SOSV’s role as a patient, technical, early partner

SOSV posts are not about excitement alone—they are about credibility and momentum.

3. POST LENGTH & STRUCTURE

Typical length:
	•	120–220 words
	•	6–10 short paragraphs or bullets
	•	Designed for skimming, not essays

Standard structure (recommended):

1. Framing statement or insight (1–2 lines)

A grounded observation or contrast:
	•	“Battery chemistry has advanced. Battery manufacturing hasn’t.”
	•	“AI-assisted labs are starting to reshape materials science.”

2. News or milestone

Clearly state what happened:
	•	Funding raised
	•	Study launched
	•	Contract awarded
	•	Technical breakthrough achieved

3. How it works / Why it matters

Explain the innovation plainly:
	•	No hype
	•	No unnecessary jargon
	•	Focus on mechanism, not marketing

4. Evidence or traction

Concrete signals:
	•	Clinical study design
	•	Government contract
	•	Performance metrics
	•	Early validation

5. Broader implication

Zoom out:
	•	Industry shift
	•	New design paradigm
	•	Change in cost, access, or scalability

6. Forward-looking close

Measured optimism:
	•	“Momentum is building.”
	•	“An important step toward…”
	•	“Still early—but meaningful.”

4. LANGUAGE & LINGUISTIC STYLE

Sentence style
	•	Short to medium length
	•	Declarative and clear
	•	Occasional contrast framing (“Instead of…”, “Despite…”)

Preferred verbs
	•	Building
	•	Executing
	•	Advancing
	•	Integrating
	•	Evaluating
	•	Unlocking
	•	Reducing
	•	Enabling

Avoid
	•	“Revolutionary,” “game-changing,” “disruptive”
	•	Exclamation-heavy enthusiasm
	•	Overuse of “proud,” “thrilled,” “excited”

⸻

5. EMOJI USAGE

Sparse, functional, and consistent

Emojis are used as visual anchors, not decoration.

Commonly used emojis
	•	🚀 Momentum / progress
	•	🧪 Science, labs, experimentation
	•	🧠 Neuroscience, AI, cognition
	•	🔋 Energy, batteries, materials
	•	🧬 Biology, biotech, diagnostics
	•	📊 Data, results, studies
	•	👥 People, teams, leadership
	•	📖 Reading / articles / press

Rules
	•	1–3 emojis per post
	•	Never mid-sentence
	•	Usually at section headers or bullets

6. TAGGING & LINKING STRATEGY

SOSV posts should actively network the ecosystem.

Tag when relevant
	•	Portfolio companies
	•	SOSV programs (IndieBio, HAX, etc.)
	•	Co-investors
	•	Key executives, founders, or board members
	•	Institutions (universities, government agencies, regulators)

Best practice
	•	Tag on first mention only
	•	Do not over-tag
	•	Prioritize relevance over reach

External links
	•	Press releases
	•	ClinicalTrials.gov
	•	Reputable media (Endpoints, MIT Tech Review, etc.)
	•	LinkedIn short links are acceptable

7. HASHTAGS

3–6 hashtags per post
Placed at the end of the post.

Core SOSV hashtags
	•	#DeepTech
	•	#HardTech
	•	#ClimateTech
	•	#Biotech
	•	#MedTech
	•	#AdvancedManufacturing

Contextual / topic-specific
	•	#EnergyStorage
	•	#AdditiveManufacturing
	•	#DefenseTech
	•	#ClinicalTrials
	•	#NonInvasiveCare
	•	#MaterialsScience
	•	#AIinScience

Avoid trending or generic tags unless directly relevant.

8. POINT OF VIEW
	•	Use third-person institutional voice (“SOSV,” “we” sparingly)
	•	Do not adopt a personal “I” voice
	•	The post represents platform-level conviction, not individual opinion

⸻

9. WHAT SOSV POSTS ARE NOT
	•	Not a founder diary
	•	Not a fundraising announcement alone
	•	Not a motivational post
	•	Not thought leadership without substance

Every post should answer:

“What real work is happening here—and why does it matter now?”

⸻

10. FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE POSTING

Before publishing, confirm:
	•	Is the milestone concrete?
	•	Is the explanation understandable to a smart non-expert?
	•	Are people and partners credited?
	•	Is optimism grounded in evidence?
	•	Would this still read well in 12–24 months?

If yes, it fits the SOSV voice.
