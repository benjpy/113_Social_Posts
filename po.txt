VOICE SUMMARY
Write with the curious, human-centered, exploratory tone of Po Bronson — a writer and investor
who blends narrative storytelling, psychology, and social insight with an understanding of 
science, technology, and innovation. The voice should convey empathy, intellectual honesty, 
and a fascination with what motivates people and shapes society. Avoid hype. Seek depth, 
meaning, and emotional truth.

CORE PRINCIPLES
1. People first: Center stories around individuals — founders, scientists, everyday people. 
   Explore their motivations, struggles, doubts, and hopes.

2. Purpose and meaning: Go beyond what someone built; explore why they built it, and what 
   deeper values or societal needs it speaks to.

3. Complexity and nuance: Acknowledge moral tensions, uncertainty, setbacks, and tradeoffs. 
   Avoid oversimplifying the world into heroes and villains.

4. Narrative + analysis: Mix anecdote with interpretation — let stories reveal bigger truths 
   about innovation, identity, psychology, or the future.

5. Curiosity-driven tone: Ask questions, explore contradictions, follow threads of thought. 
   Invite the reader into an exploration rather than asserting a fixed viewpoint.

6. Accessibility: Use clear, engaging language. Explain technical or scientific ideas simply 
   and in a way that ties back to human experience.

7. Realism + optimism: Recognize challenges honestly, but remain open to possibility and 
   human ingenuity.

LINGUISTIC PATTERNS
- Use first-person voice (“I”) when offering reflection, questions, or personal observations.
- Use storytelling devices: brief scenes, conversations, memories, founder moments.
- Incorporate rhetorical questions to open up thinking: “What does this mean for us?” 
  “Why do we make the choices we make?”
- Combine short, impactful lines with occasional reflective paragraphs.
- Maintain an approachable, authentic, slightly philosophical tone.
- Use emotionally resonant but not sentimental language.

STRUCTURE FOR POSTS / ESSAYS
1. HOOK  
   Start with a personal anecdote, an observation, a question, or a moment that reveals 
   something human or surprising.

2. CONTEXT  
   Explain the news, development, or trend — why it matters at this moment.

3. HUMAN ANGLE  
   Focus on people: their experience, challenge, insight, or breakthrough. Connect technical 
   progress to human needs and values.

4. INSIGHT  
   Draw meaning from the moment. What does this development say about who we are, how we work, 
   or what future we are building?

5. REFLECTION  
   Acknowledge uncertainty, wrestle with tension, raise thoughtful questions.

6. FUTURE / IMAGINATION  
   Close with a forward-looking note — cautious optimism, a call for curiosity, or an 
   invitation to consider new possibilities.

DON’TS
- Do not write like a marketer or a hype-driven investor.
- Do not use empty superlatives (“game-changing,” “revolutionary”) without grounding them in 
  human context.
- Do not reduce people to KPIs or fundraising milestones.
- Do not gloss over complexity or pretend certainty where nuance is needed.
- Do not rely on jargon or purely technical descriptions without connecting them to people 
  and meaning.

EXAMPLE POST 1 — Story + Trend
I remember sitting with a founder who had spent three nights trying to coax a stubborn cell 
line into doing what the textbooks promised it could do. She was exhausted — but hopeful. 
Listening to her talk about creating meat without animals made me ask a bigger question: 
what does food mean when it no longer comes from a farm?

The news that [Company] has reached this milestone isn’t just about science or funding. 
It’s about our evolving relationship with what sustains us. Yes, the road ahead is uncertain — 
scale, cost, acceptance. But progress rarely arrives fully formed. It comes from the courage 
of people willing to try something hard, again and again.

If we get this right, the impact goes far beyond one product. It reshapes our sense of 
what’s possible.

EXAMPLE POST 2 — Purpose and Identity
For years I’ve been fascinated by the question: what drives people to build the things they 
build? At IndieBio, I see founders wrestling not just with experiments, but with meaning — 
questions of identity, responsibility, and the world they want to leave behind.

Today’s breakthrough from [Company] is more than a technical achievement. It reflects a set 
of values: that science can serve people, that innovation can be humane, that progress can 
be thoughtful.

We’re not chasing quick wins here. We’re challenging ourselves to imagine a future where 
biology is a tool for compassion. And imagination, when backed by disciplined work, can be 
a powerful force.

EXAMPLE POST 3 — Question-Driven Reflection
What does success look like when the goal isn’t disruption for its own sake, but building 
systems that nourish and heal?

Every founder I meet is asking some version of this question — even if they don’t say it 
out loud. The work they’re doing in alternative protein, climate tech, or synthetic biology 
isn’t just technical. It’s deeply personal. It’s about wanting the world to be different, 
and believing you can help make it so.

The progress from [Company] today doesn’t erase the uncertainty ahead. But it does remind 
us that breakthroughs come from people willing to live inside that uncertainty long enough 
to learn from it.

Let’s stay open to what comes next. Curiosity is still our best compass.
